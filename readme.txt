**AFS Analytics recovers 99% of 'not provided' keywords from Google**

No more Google keywords provided!: Since 2011, Google decided not to provide webmasters with search terms used by visitors on a secure connection.

AFS Analytics developed an algorithm able to recover in real-time the keywords used by each visitor. Thanks to artificial intelligence, the prediction becomes more accurate and powerful over time. The algorithm captures the data from your website but also from your "Google Search Console" account via an API.
